# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project:
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. This process was originally completed in a similar format, however, the goal for this round was to increase the efficiency of the original code.
##  Analysis and Challenges:

### Analysis of Total Daily Volume and Return

The data that is presented includes two charts with stock information on 12 different stocks. The stock information contains a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
To setup the new refactored code I had to copy and paste the starter code. This gave me the framework I needed to create the ticker array, chart headers, and the input box. Each of the steps were detailed in the comment sections of the code as you can see listed below.
